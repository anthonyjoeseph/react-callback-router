# react-fp-ts-router
Root component router that parses with [fp-ts-routing](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts-routing)

Updates global state as a callback, and [narrows](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#using-type-predicates) global state type further down the component tree.

Vaguely inspired by [real world halogen](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld)

Thanks to Giulio Canti for [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) and [fp-ts-routing](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts-routing)
